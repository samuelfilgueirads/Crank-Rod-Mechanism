Crankshaft and rod mechanism: Kinematic and dynamic analysis with animation

The governing equations are based on the following reference: S. Doughty, Mechanics of machines. Wiley, 1988.

The schematics of the simulated mechanism is presented below.

In the first animation, we have a kinematic analysis of the mechanism for uniform and non-uniform motions.

In the second animation, the dynamic characteristics of the elements are also evaluated.

Finally, one hypothetical case that considers piston eccentricity is investigated.
